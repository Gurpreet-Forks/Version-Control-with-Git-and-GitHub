Ease of delivery by a team, is proportionately influenced, by its ability to incorporate change. Version control drives this by allowing for ease of change and contribution to a codebase. This course draws attention to the facets that make up version control. This encompasses tracking of codebase changes, how to host a codebase to support remote access, managing contributors and contributions, and finally, the best practices to adhere to in the practice of version control. By implementing version control, creation and enforcement of team driven checks and controls for introduction, scrutiny, approval, merging and reversal of changes when the occasion necessitates, is realized.

This book takes a completely different approach from any online material by taking the learner through basic individual Git usage to a collaborative Git workflow on teams. It encompasses 2 segments. 
In the first section, we explore Git as an everyday tool for the individual. This part takes the learner through the commands utilized when working with a repository and its subsequent files and branches. In the second part, we explain the usage of Git and GitHub in deployment, debugging, and versioning applications, collaboratively.
